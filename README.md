# Code Crackers AI/ML Learning Repository

Welcome to the official **Code Crackers AI/ML Learning Repository**.  
This repository is structured as a 12-week guided journey into the world of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, with weekly content, resources, coding practice, and structured learning tasks.

---

## About the Domain: AI & ML

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** enables machines to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks like decision-making, language understanding, and visual perception.

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that empowers machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

This domain powers technologies such as:
- Recommendation Systems (e.g., Netflix, YouTube)
- Image and Speech Recognition
- Natural Language Processing (e.g., Chatbots)
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Fraud Detection

Through this program, you'll gain hands-on experience with Python, core ML algorithms, data science tools, and model deployment techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Git-Rexdev/Code-Crackers-AIML-Resources.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the weekly guide folder:
   ```bash
   Code-Crackers-AIML-Resources/Weekly_Guide
   ```

3. Open the relevant week's markdown file to begin learning.

Use the `Notebooks/` directory for coding practice and `Datasets/` for exercises.

## Weekly Progress Tracker

Each student must maintain a **private GitHub repository** to document their weekly progress.  
This personal log should include learnings, exercises, and task completions.

---

## Contribution & Usage

This repository is maintained by the **Code Crackers Club** and is intended solely for educational use during the AI/ML learning program.
