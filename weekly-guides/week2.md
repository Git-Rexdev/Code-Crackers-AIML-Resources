# Code Crackers Club ‚Äì AI/ML Week 2

Welcome to **Week 2** of the **AI/ML Learning Series** by Code Crackers.  
This week is dedicated to learning **Data Processing** and **Data Visualization**, essential for understanding and analyzing any dataset before applying machine learning models.

---

## Week 2 Learning Resources

### 1. Advanced Data Processing with Pandas  
Dive deeper into Pandas to clean, transform, group, and manipulate datasets effectively.

---

### 2. Handling Missing and Outlier Data  
Learn how to detect and handle missing values and outliers to prepare data for reliable analysis.

---

### 3. NumPy for Numerical Operations  
Use NumPy for fast array operations, statistical summaries, and numerical computations.

---

### 4. Data Visualization with Matplotlib  
Visualize trends, distributions, and comparisons using Matplotlib‚Äôs plotting capabilities.

---

### 5. Statistical Visualizations with Seaborn  
Use Seaborn to quickly generate informative plots like heatmaps, boxplots, and violin plots for statistical analysis.

---

## üìù Task for Week 2

Download any public dataset (e.g., Titanic, Iris, FIFA, Netflix, etc.) and complete the following tasks:

### 1. Data Processing
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Identify and handle missing values.
- Perform at least one **groupby** operation.
- Normalize or scale one numeric column.
- Use NumPy to compute at least three summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, std).

### 2. Data Visualization
Create the following visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
- A **bar plot** to compare grouped data (e.g., average scores by category).
- A **line plot** to show a trend over time or index.
- A **heatmap** to show correlation between numerical columns.
- An **optional** boxplot or histogram for distribution insight.

2. A Jupyter Notebook (`Week2_Task.ipynb`) containing:
   - All code for processing and visualization
   - Clean formatting with Markdown cells
   - Explanations of each step

3. Summary of:
   - Libraries used
   - What you learned
   - Any issues faced and how you solved them
   - Screenshots or insights from your plots (optional)
